# Unsupervised-Discovery-of-U.S.-Electricity-Consumption-Regimes-2015-2024-
Project Overview

Electricity demand patterns are shaped by seasonality, economic activity, policy changes, and external shocks. Understanding these patterns—without relying on predefined labels—is critical for utilities, market analysts, and grid planners seeking to anticipate stress periods, plan capacity, and improve system resilience.

This project applies unsupervised machine learning to monthly U.S. electric power data from 2015 to 2024 to uncover latent consumption regimes, detect structural shifts, and identify anomalous periods in national electricity behavior. Using clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection techniques, the analysis reveals distinct energy usage patterns and transitions over time.

All modeling and analysis are performed in a single, self-contained Jupyter notebook using a CSV-only dataset, with an emphasis on interpretability, real-world relevance, and decision-ready insights.
